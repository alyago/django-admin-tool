The unit, originally called the Naval Reserve, was created in response to increased military activity during World War I, providing the manpower to fill aircraft cockpits and anticipate submarine threats. The Naval Reserve went on to participate in major American military conflicts, such as World War II and the Cold War, as well as disaster relief missions and humanitarian programs. In 2005, the unit\u2019s name was slightly altered to create its current title, the Navy Reserve.', u'Description 2': u'The Naval branch is responsible for defending the coastal borders of the United States, protecting U.S. interests in overseas trade, and engaging with incoming threats by sea.

Reservists can enlist in a wide variety of occupational specialties within the unit, though all departments require members to serve one weekend per month and two weeks per year.
